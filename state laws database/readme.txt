This folder (state laws database) contains a database of state laws governing annexation.
There are two csv files:
- statelawsdatabase1 organizes a table with each state as a row and each law as a column, with 1 or 0 indicating if that state has a law for that
- statelawsdatabase2 organizes the data with each row containing the state followed a list of its laws
The convertStateLawsCSV.py file converts the statelawsdatabase1 into statelawsdatabase2

The different laws are taken from Noah J. Durst (2018) Racial Gerrymandering of Municipal Borders: Direct
Democracy, Participatory Democracy, and Voting Rights in the United States, Annals of the
American Association of Geographers, 108:4, 938-954, DOI: 10.1080/24694452.2017.1403880

The particular state annexation laws are taken from Table 3 of Durst.
